Given the basic salary as input, write a program to calculate the bonus and display it.

The bonus will be calculated based on the below category.
Basic>20000 bonus=17%of basic+1500
Basic>15000 bonus=15%of basic+1200
Basic>10000 bonus=12%of basic+1000
for rest =8%of basic+500

Input and Output Format :

First line of input consists of n, the basic salary.
Output is a single integer that displays the bonus.

Print "Number too large" when the given input numbers is greater than 32767 .
Print "Number too small" when the given input is a negative number.

Include a function named calculateBonus(int basic) whose return type is an integer, the bonus.

Sample Input 1:
21000

Sample Output 1:
5070

Sample Input 2:
327678
Sample Output 2:
Number too large

	John is working in a bank. He has created account details transaction in a file and protected it with a password. He sent the file to his manager for review. 
The file is protected with a password. The password is the sum of Prime numbers. Write a function to generate the password.

Input and Output Format:
First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. Output consist of an integer, which is the sum.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative number available in the input array and terminate the program.
3) Print 0, when there are no prime numbers in a given input array.

Include a function named sumPrimeArray(int array[], int size) whose return type is an integer, which is the prime sum.
