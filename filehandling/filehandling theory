Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given an input array which contains age of some employees, write a program to find the sum of ages of employees greater than 18.

Input and Output Format :
First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. Output consist of an integer, which is the sum.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative number available in the input array and terminate the program.

Include a function named newArraySum(int age[],int size) whose return type is an integer, which is the sum.

Sample Input 1:
5
21
22
17
10
25
Sample Output 1:
68

Sample Input 2:

Write a program to find if 
If the size of the array is negative or if any element in the array is negative or if the average marks scored by the student is greater than 99 , print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program.
 Input and Output Format:
Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. The next 'n' integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Output consists of a string --- “First Grade University” or “Second Grade University” or “Third Grade University” or “Invalid Input”.
Assume that the maximum size of the array is 20.
Sample Input 1:
5
92
87
78
74
80
 
Sample Output 1:
First Grade University
 Sample Input 2:
-5
Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
5
23
2
-5
 Sample Output 3:
Invalid Input

    Q2 Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Student Fees is calculated according to the student's 10th marks. The student will get discount in fees as follows :

Marks discount(%)
>90         -  50%
81-90      - 25%
70-80      - 10%
<70         -  0%
Calculate the fees according to above table.

Note:
Formula : fees - (fees* discount(%))
Print "Invalid mark" if the mark is greater than 100
Print "Invalid fee" if the fee is greater than 32767
Print "Invalid input" if any of the input is negative

Input and Output Format :
First line of input represents the fee, second line of input represents the marks of student.

Sample Input 1:
10000
95
Sample Output 1:
5000

Sample Input 2:
15896
101
Sample Output 2:
Invalid mark
